column_style: alphabetic
method_notes: Associations between host/lifestyle factors and microbiome diversity. Associations were tested by fitting linear regression models of Shannon diversity on each analyte, adjusting for age, sex, race of the individual, the season in which the microbiome sample was taken, and the microbiome sequencing vendor. Only factors with multiple hypotheses correction FDR p-value < 0.05 are shown.
